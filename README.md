# Overview
An affordability calculator for prospective movers and current residents in the Bay Area to find out if their current or new living standards are economically feasible

# **BayBalance's Societal Impact**

During current times, thousands of residents within California look to reside in various Bay Area communities. Whether its for school, work, or just in general, thousands find themselves within this area, struggling to meet financial ends due to the unawareness around the cost of living within these communities. BayBalance looks to allign itself with the United Nations SDG's 3 and 8 and combat these problems by helping alleviate financial stress and promoting economic growth through its three features.

1) Affordability Calculator
2) Expense Categorizer
3) Mortgage Loan Calculator

BayBalance looks to make its biggest impact in the finacial decision making of the community. If we can inform our users and stop them from putting themselves in a struggling position in the future, then our overall goal has been achieved.

# **Our Solution**

During the development of BayBalance, several quality prototypes were developed in hopes of aiding the financial decisions made by Bay Area residents. We focused on leveraging OpenAI to help provide valuable information to our Users to keep them informed about their decisions. Our application involves three main sections, each playing a valuable role for the next. First within the expense categorizer, Users can list their expenses for the day, week or month, and it will automatically sort out each purchase into different categories and give them the overall total. From these results, Users can bring that information to our Affordability calculator. Within this feature, Users select their targeted community of residence in the Bay Area and input their financial expenses and goals. These User inputs then interact with OpenAI functions, that project to them the feasibility of living in that area as well as possible other areas to look into if it is not possible. Lastly, the Mortgage Loan calculator is an interactive feature where Users can determine a realistic mortgage payment based off a loan they would take to purchase a house. This interactive feature takes in User credit scores and adjusts the interest rate and payment to match what they would see from local bank, which could help back their overall decision and have them financially prepared before.
